# React TodoMVC Example with ESP Integration

This React example integrates ESP (Evented State Processing) for its model.

> ESP is a new architectural design pattern for managing the 'M' in your MVC application, based on reactive programming and domain driven design. ESP takes the concept of unidirectional data flow to the next level by adding a clear model that comprehensively captures your entire application's state. The model is published to your controllers as a single observable stream of changes. Inside the the model, ESP events and processors provide a scalable pattern for decomposing complicated interdependent logic into manageable chunks. It's great for big, complex applications with complex state transitions and real-time events (e.g. streaming data).

> React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Its core principles are declarative code, efficiency, and flexibility. Simply specify what your component looks like and React will keep it up-to-date when the underlying data changes.
